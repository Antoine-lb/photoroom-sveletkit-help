# Implementing Photoroom API in SveltKit

Hello ðŸ‘‹
I apologize for the beginner question, but I am struggling to implement the API. I have the image, but I am unsure how to pass it to the API (blob, base64, stream, etc.). I am not familiar with working with images in NodeJS.

The documentation shows how to read the image from disk, but my image is coming from the client.

I have attempted two methods - fetching the image from an S3 bucket (preferred method) and from a form with an input file - but neither of them have worked ðŸ˜‚

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!
